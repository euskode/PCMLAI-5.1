Welcome to my first PCMLAI Github project. 

The goal of this Jupyter notebook is to answer all the questions from practical application assignment 5.1, as well as to report on the independent investigation section.

To read my answers, please open `notebook/prompt.ipynb` in your Jupyter Notebook environment.

Below is a summary of findings for the independent investigation section.

For coupons of type `Coffee House`, drivers with the following characteristics accepted coupon offers at a rate of 89.8%.

- driver goes to caf√©s at least once a month
- driver has nowhere urgent or specific to be after their delivery
- driver has a friend or partner as passenger
- driver is single or divorced
- driving time is 10AM or 2PM
- coupon expiration is 1 day

This acceptance rate is 38.5% higher than all the other drivers.

For more detail, feel free to dig deeper! Answers to the initial `Problems` section are provided within the notebook itself.
